
# MobilesHQ

This is my personal project in django, an e-commerce website selling mobiles.

Developed using Django, HTML, CSS, ReactJS, Javascript, MySQL

It is incomplete and I am not sure if I will ever complete it but still I worked on it for a long while and added lots of functionality.

You can view a product, choose the color and storage you want which was all done in ReactJS and add it to the cart which will be saved. There are other cool features inside too.
